Extract the zip files and keep all files in a single folder. Program has been split to multiple files for convenience.

All programs have been implemented in python 3.10.7. So, make sure to test the programs with python3.
There are multiple external python packages used to implement the programs like sklearn, pandas etc.
Make sure to install these packages if you face any "ModuleNotFoundError:". Use command "pip3 install module-name".

Before running, replace the path to the data set folders in Loader.py, line 5.

To run the programs, execute the following python files from the directory containing all files
problem 1 :
> python3 DMA4-1.py
problem 2 :
> python3 DMA4-2.py
problem 3 :
> python3 DMA4-3.py

The programs may take a while to execute, so please wait for the output to show up.
