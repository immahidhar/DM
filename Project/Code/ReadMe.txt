## Code is in ipynb format which requires Jupyter Notebook or google colab to run the code file

# Code is sequential format so it needs to be executed cell by cell or it can also be ran by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Enter

#Main code file is Datamining_Project.ipynb
#OutputCompare.ipynb is only used for visualization purpose.

# Place the datafile in the same location as the code file to run without interuptions or
# Change the data path according to path of the data file.
# Similarly save the outputs of the previous script to the current working directory and use the same path in the OutputCompare.ipynb 
# code file.

# Packages required to the run the code are as follows
1.pandas
2.numpy
3.mat4py
4.os
5.scipy
6.matplotlib.pyplot
7.random
8.sklearn
